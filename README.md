# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Energy Consumption in NYC

- Objective: The goal of this project is to predict energy consumption in NYC over the course of one year. As an introductory project to learning about time series analysis and forecasting, we aim to perform basic exploratory data analysis and STL decomposition.

- Methodology: The project will involve the use of SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with an exogenous variable as the temperature, day, day of the week and month ) to predict energy consumption.

- Failure to forecast seasonally adjusted data using STL Decomposition as the adjusted data is complex
